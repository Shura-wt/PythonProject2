# Workaround for docker-compose v1.29.2 on newer Docker Engine
# Prevents KeyError: 'ContainerConfig' during `docker-compose up` by pinning the
# client API level used by docker-compose when talking to the Docker Engine.
# If you are using Docker Compose v2+ (docker compose), you can remove this or upgrade compose.
DOCKER_API_VERSION=1.41
# Optional: reduce noise when services change
